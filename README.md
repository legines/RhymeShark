Are you struggling writing lyrics? Do you need some sick rhymes? This app aims to help users create lyrics by using the Words API to match a searched word with rhymes. The Musixmatch API is used to present songs, album art, and lyrics that contain the searched word. Users will have the opportunity to apply certain filers (genre, popularity, release date, and language) to their searches. This is used to show the user examples of how their word of interest is used by other artists.
